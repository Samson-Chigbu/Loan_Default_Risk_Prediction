# Loan_Default_Risk_Prediction
Loan Default Risk Prediction is a machine learning project that leverages historical loan application and repayment data to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their loan.  This project aims to help financial institutions reduce default rates, improve credit risk management, and optimize loan approval decisions.
